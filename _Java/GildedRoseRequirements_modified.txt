Gilded Rose Requirements Specification
======================================

Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items.

	- All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
	- All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
	- At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item

	- Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast    - sellIn <= 0 then quality =* -2
	- The Quality of an item is never negative
	- "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
	- The Quality of an item is never more than 50
	- "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
	- "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches;
	Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
	Quality drops to 0 after the concert

We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:

	- "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

- item can never have its Quality increase above 50,
- "Sulfuras" is a legendary item and as such its Quality is 80 and it never alters.


Restrictions

  - do not alter the Item class or Items property
   - you can make the UpdateQuality method and Items property static if you like, we'll cover for you.
